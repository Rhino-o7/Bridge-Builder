## Bridge Buidler is a 2D topdown game where you have to find all the cats in the level by building bridges to the cat. You have limited bridegs and each level gets bigger with more cats to find.

- The map is randomly generated each level using a Perlin noise map.
- Each ground tile has different variations based on what surrounding tiles have water.
- This project was a solo project built with Unity for a game jam.
